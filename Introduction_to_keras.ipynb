The palate is saturated but shows good texture and flow, while the flavors and essence of cassis, raspberry and eucaplytus are ingrained all the way to the finish. Springy, tasty and attractive, but not complicated.\n",

The silky texture and bright acidity make it drinkable now, yet it should develop in the bottle over the next six years.\n",
